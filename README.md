# Data-Intensive-Programming
This course deals with managing and analysing big data. An understanding is gained of modern solutions for data-intensive programming.

The amount of data in the world has exploded during the last decade. This has lead to a setting where the traditional methods and tools are not anymore suitable for capturing, curating, managing, and processing data whose volume exceeds terabytes. Therefore, new approaches has been developed to cope with big data. 

One of the most prominent framework for processing big data is Apache Spark, which is developed for distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers. The framework is written in Scala, but a language binding exists for several commonly used languages.

Scala and Apache Spark are used.
